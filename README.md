# Tacotron 2

A PyTorch implementation of Tacotron2, described in [Natural TTS Synthesis By Conditioning Wavenet On Mel Spectrogram Predictions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05884.pdf), an end-to-end text-to-speech(TTS) neural network architecture, which directly converts character text sequence to speech.

## Dataset

[LJ Speech Dataset](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/)

## Dependency

- Python 3.5.2
- PyTorch 1.0.0

## Usage
### Data Pre-processing
Extract data:
```bash
$ python extract.py
```

### Train
```bash
$ python train.py
```

If you want to visualize during training, run in your terminal:
```bash
$ tensorboard --logdir runs
```

### Demo
Generate mel-spectrogram for text "Waveglow is really awesome!"
```bash
$ python demo.py
```
